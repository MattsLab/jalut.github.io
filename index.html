If I were fire
<br>
If I were fire, I would consume the world;
<br>
If I were wind, then I would blow it down; 
<br>
If I were water, I would make it drown; 
<br>
If I were God, t'would to the depths be hurled.
<br>
If I were Pope, I'd have a lot of fun 
<br>
with how I'd make all Christians work for me; 
<br>
If I were emperor, then you'd really see -
<br>
I'd have the head cut off of everyone.
<br>
If I were death, then I'd go to my father; 
<br>
If I were life, I'd not abide with him; 
<br>
And so, and so, would I do to my mother.
<br>If I were Cecco - as in fact I am - 
I'd chase the young and pretty girls; to others 
<br>
Would I leave the lame or wrinkled dam
<BR>
